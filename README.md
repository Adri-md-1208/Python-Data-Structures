## General info
A data structure is a particular way storing and organizing data in a computer for efficient access and modification.

The data structures can be [linear](https://github.com/Adri-md-1208/Python-Data-Structures/tree/master/Linear%20Structures) or [non-linear](https://github.com/Adri-md-1208/Python-Data-Structures/tree/master/Non-Linear Structures) depending on the way it stores the data. The python language also have some [predefined data structures](https://github.com/Adri-md-1208/Python-Data-Structures/tree/master/Linear Structures/Predefined Structures).
All data structures have defined own [algorithms](https://github.com/Adri-md-1208/Python-Data_Structures/tree/master/Algorithms) for different proposes.

## Technologies
* Python: 3.8.4

You can also see your python version by typing in the command line:
````
python --version
```` 
or opening the python shell and check the version:

## Setup
Nothing for now.

### Finished
This repo is now closed. I may add new data structures and algorithms in a future.
